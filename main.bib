abstract = {While our knowledge about the roles of microbes and viruses in the ocean has increased tremendously due to recent advances in genomics and metagenomics, research on marine microbial eukaryotes and zooplankton has benefited much less from these new technologies because of their larger genomes, their enormous diversity, and largely unexplored physiologies. Here, we use a metatranscriptomics approach to capture expressed genes in open ocean Tara Oceans stations across four organismal size fractions. The individual sequence reads cluster into 116 million unigenes representing the largest reference collection of eukaryotic transcripts from any single biome. The catalog is used to unveil functions expressed by eukaryotic marine plankton, and to assess their functional biogeography. Almost half of the sequences have no similarity with known proteins, and a great number belong to new gene families with a restricted distribution in the ocean. Overall, the resource provides the foundations for exploring the roles of marine eukaryotes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Thermotoga maritima has a temperature optimum for growth of 80° and can metabolize many simple and complex carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, starch, xylan, and cellulose. Both xylan and cellulose are complex plant polymers; xylan represents the most abundant noncellulosic polysaccharide in angiosperms, where it accounts for 20-30\% of the dry weight of wood tissues. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer occurring in nature, estimated to account for 75 × 109 tons of dry plant biomass annually. Both cellulose and xylan, through conversion to fuels (e.g., H2), have major potential as renewable carbon and energy sources. Most other Thermotoga strains have been isolated in continental oil reservoirs and oil-producing wells. All, however, demonstrate the characteristic toga-like sheath structure that surrounds the cells and an ability to ferment a range of carbohydrate substrates. From an evolutionary standpoint, the Thermotogales are significant, as small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) phylogenetic analysis of T. maritima placed the bacterium as the deepest and most slowly evolving lineage in the Eubacteria.}

@article{Moreau2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bathycoccus prasinos is an extremely small cosmopolitan marine green alga whose cells are covered with intricate spider's web patterned scales that develop within the Golgi cisternae before their transport to the cell surface. The objective of this work is to sequence and analyze its genome, and to present a comparative analysis with other known genomes of the green lineage.
RESEARCH: Its small genome of 15 Mb consists of 19 chromosomes and lacks transposons. Although 70{\%} of all B. prasinos genes share similarities with other Viridiplantae genes, up to 428 genes were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer, mainly from other eukaryotes. Two chromosomes, one big and one small, are atypical, an unusual synapomorphic feature within the Mamiellales. Genes on these atypical outlier chromosomes show lower GC content and a significant fraction of putative horizontal gene transfer genes. Whereas the small outlier chromosome lacks colinearity with other Mamiellales and contains many unknown genes without homologs in other species, the big outlier shows a higher intron content, increased expression levels and a unique clustering pattern of housekeeping functionalities. Four gene families are highly expanded in B. prasinos, including sialyltransferases, sialidases, ankyrin repeats and zinc ion-binding genes, and we hypothesize that these genes are associated with the process of scale biogenesis.
CONCLUSION: The minimal genomes of the Mamiellophyceae provide a baseline for evolutionary and functional analyses of metabolic processes in green plants.},

abstract = {Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is synthesized and used by marine phytoplankton as an osmolyte. Previous studies have shown that some of the dissolved DMSP (DMSPd) in seawater is taken up by bacterioplankton and not degraded. We tested the hypothesis that retention of DMSP provides some benefits to marine bacteria. In experiments with coastal seawater filtrates containing mainly bacteria, acute osmotic stresses of +5 and +10 ppt NaCl significantly inhibited bacterial production (BP) over 6 h, while the availability of 20 nM DMSPd relieved most of the BP inhibition. Partial relief of salt-induced inhibition of BP was observed with DMSPd concentrations as low as 2.5 nM, and DMSP was more effective at relieving osmotic stress than other compounds tested. Osmotic stresses resulted in a faster and greater overall uptake of DMSPd and accumulation of untransformed DMSP in bacterial cells (DMSPcell). Retained DMSP reached osmotically-significant intracellular concentrations of 54 mM in salt-stressed bacterial populations. Retention of DMSP was accompanied by a lower production of methanethiol (MeSH), suggesting a down-regulation of the demethylation/demethiolation pathway under osmotic stress. These results show that estuarine bacterioplankton can use DMSP as an osmoprotectant, retaining up to 54{\%} of the available dissolved DMSP un-transformed in their cells. This benefit provided by DMSP may help explain why some DMSP is retained in bacteria in the ocean, even under unchanging salinity. This retention slows down the cycling of DMSP, with potential implications for the trophic transfer of DMSP and its contributions to sulfur and carbon fluxes in the ocean.},

abstract = {The quantitative significance of the nitrogenous compound glycine betaine (GBT) and its sulfur analog dimelhylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to intracellular pools in marine phytoplankton is not well known. In a series of experiments conducted in August 1993, we measured these compounds, as well as total organic sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen, over the growth cycle in six isolates of marine phytoplankton, Amphidinium car ferae Hulburt, Chrysocromulina sp. Lackey, Emiliania huxleyi Hay et Mohler, Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve, and Tetraselmis sp. At the same time, we measured cellular concentrations of protein, amino acids, chlorophyll, and inorganic nutrients. All six species produced DMSP, while three produced GET at lesser levels. In the Chrysochromulina sp. isolate, levels of GET were greater than DMSP during the exponential phase of growth, but declined sharply as the culture approached stationary phase. This change appeared to coincide with the onset of nitrogen limitation. Other nitrogenous osmolytes were produced in five of the six species but in much smaller quantities. DMSP contributed significantly to cellular sulfur throughout the growth cycle although, in some algae, the proportion of dissolved DMSP increased substantially during stationary growth. When present, GET formed a sizeable fraction of the cellular nitrogen only during exponential growth. A significant percentage (ca. 50{\%}) of the organic nitrogen could not be accounted for even when cellular pools of protein, amino acids, inorganic nitrogen, and nitrogenous osmolytes were combined. Based on these experiments, there does not appear to be a reciprocal relationship between DMSP and GET production, although GET production does appear to be correlated with nitrogen availability.},

abstract = {The nitrogenous organic osmolyte glycine betaine (GBT) and its sulfur analog dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) are quantitatively significant solutes in many marine algae. Although an inverse relationship has been suggested between these two compounds in marine phytoplankton that may be regulated by nitrogen availability, our results in Part I of this work (same issue) showed no such relationship in batch cultures of six species. In experiments conducted in August 1994, we reexamined this relationship in three axenic strains of phytoplankton [Thalassiosira pseudonana (Hustedt) Hasle et Heimdal, Emiliania huxleyi Hay et Mohler, and Amphidinium carterae Hulbert] in chemostat cultures at three N-limited growth rates. Levels of DMSP, GET, and homarine, another nitrogenous osmolyte, were inversely related in T. pseudonama, with GET and homarine preferentially produced at the highest growth rate when cells were N-replete. DMSP concentrations did not change in E. huxleyi, although GET and homarine levels did increase at the highest growth rate. In A. carterae, neither DMSP nor GET varied in any systematic way. In all three algae, additions of nitrogen to N-limited cultures resulted in short-term increases in GET production. Levels of cellular DMSP remained fairly constant in E. huxleyi and A. car-tel ae and were much greater than levels of comparable nitrogenous osmolytes like GET and homarine. The dominance of DMSP makes a reciprocal relationship with the nitrogenous osmolytes unlikely in most species. Phytoplankton appear to be capable of directly assimilating extracellular GET, although it is not known if they eliminate equivalent amounts of DMSP in the process.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify the compatible solutes accumulated by Pseudomonas putida S12 subjected to osmotic stress. In response to reduced water activity, P. putida S12 accumulated N$\alpha$-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide (NAGGN) simultaneously with a novel compatible solute identified as mannitol (using 13C- and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography methods) to maximum concentrations of 74 and 258 $\mu$mol g (dry weight) of cells-1, respectively. The intracellular amounts of each solute varied with both the type and amount of osmolyte applied to induce osmotic stress in the medium. Both solutes were synthesized de novo. Addition of betaine to the medium resulted in accumulation of this compound and depletion of both NAGGN and mannitol. Mannitol and NAGGN were accumulated when sucrose instead of salts was used to reduce the medium water activity. Furthermore, both compatible solutes were accumulated when glucose was substituted by other carbon sources. However, the intracellular quantities of mannitol decreased when fructose, succinate, or lactate were applied as a carbon source. Mannitol was also raised to high intracellular concentrations by other salt-stressed Pseudomonas putida strains. This is the first study demonstrating a principal role fur the de novo-synthesized polyol mannitol in osmoadaptation of a heterotrophic eubacterium.},

abstract = {Shallow-living marine invertebrates use free amino acids as cellular osmolytes, while most teleosts use almost no organic osmolytes. Recently we found unusual osmolyte compositions in deep-sea animals. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increases with depth in muscles of some teleosts, skates, and crustaceans (up to 300 mmol/kg at 2900 m). Other deep-sea animals had high levels of (1) scyllo-inositol in echinoderms, gastropods, and polychaetes, (2) that polyol plus ??-alanine and betaine in octopods, (3) hypotaurine, N-methyltaurine, and unidentified methylamines in vestimentiferans from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, and (4) a depth-correlated serine-phosphate osmolyte in vesicomyid clams from trench seeps. We hypothesize that some of these solutes counteract effects of hydrostatic pressure. With lactate dehydrogenase, actin, and pyruvate kinase, 250 mM TMAO (but not glycine) protected both ligand binding and protein stability against pressure. To test TMAO in living cells, we grew yeast under pressure. After 1 h at 71 MPa, 3.5 h at 71 MPa, and 17 h at 30 MPa, 150 mM TMAO generally doubled the number of cells that formed colonies. Sulfur-based osmolytes which are not correlated with depth, such as hypotaurine and thiotaurine, are probably involved in sulfide metabolism and detoxification. Thus deep-sea osmolytes may have at least two other roles beyond acting as simple compatible osmotica. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Virgibacillus pantothenticus has been shown to synthesize the compatible solute ectoine in response to high salinity or low growth temperature. We found that exogenously provided ectoine and hydroxyectoine also serve as protectants against these challenges. Transport studies with [ 14C]ectoine revealed that both types of stress induced a high-affinity ectoine uptake activity in V. pantothenticus. By using an Escherichia coli mutant defective in osmoprotectant uptake systems, a functional complementation approach for osmostress resistance in the presence of ectoine was employed to retrieve a gene encoding an ectoine transporter from V. pantothenticus. The cloned gene (ectT) encodes a protein (EctT) that is a member of the BCCT (betaine-choline-carnitinetransporter) family of carriers. Osmoprotection assays demonstrated that the EctT carrier mediates the preferential import of ectoine and hydroxyectoine but also possesses minor uptake activities for the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine. Northern blot analysis with RNA isolated from V. pantothenticus revealed that a rise in the external osmolality or a reduction in growth temperature strongly increased the transcription of the ectT gene. Primer extension analysis demonstrated that ectT was transcribed under these conditions from a SigB-type promoter. SigB is the master regulator of the general stress regulon of bacilli and provides protection to cells against various challenges, including high salinity and low temperature. Both the synthesis of ectoine and the EctT-mediated uptake of ectoine and hydroxyectoine are triggered by the same environmental cues, high salinity and cold stress, and thereby provide, in a concerted fashion, the protection of V. pantothenticus against these challenges. {\textcopyright} 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

Though V. anguillarum is able to proliferate while maintain its pathogenicity under low temperature (5–18°C), so far, coldadaption molecular mechanism of the bacteria is unknown. In this study, V. anguillarum was found possessing a putative glycine betaine synthesis system, which is encoded by betABI and synthesizes glycine betaine from its precursor choline. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of the bet gene at the transcriptional level was noted in log phase in response to cold-stress. Moreover, the accumulation of betaine glycine was only found appearing at low growth temperatures, suggesting that response regulation of both synthesis system and transporter system are cold-dependent. Furthermore, in-frame deletion mutation in the two putative ABC transporters and three putative BCCT family transporters associated with glycine betaine uptake could not block cellular accumulation of betaine glycine in V. anguillarum under coldstress, suggesting the redundant feature in V. anguillarum betaine transporter system. These findings confirmed that glycine betaine serves as an effective cold stress protectant and highlighted an underappreciated facet of the acclimatization of V. anguillarum to cold environments.},

At all locations, 14C-GBT was rapidly taken up into particulate material ({\textgreater}0.2 $\mu$m). Formalin treatment, autoclaving, or prefiltration of water through 0.2-$\mu$m membranes completely inhibited 14C-GBT uptake, indicating the process was biologically mediated, probably by bacteria. During the first several hours of uptake, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the label found in particulates was recovered as untransformed 14C-GBT. This fraction diminished over longer incubations but never fell below 16{\%}, indicating some longer term storage of GBT in microorganisms. Respiration of the added label to 14CO2 was typically {\textless}5{\%} of the total uptake during 5-10-min incubations but increased to approximately 40-60{\%} after 24-48 h. Increasing the salinity of an estuarine water tiltrate culture from 14 to 25 or 35 resulted in greater retention of 14C-GBT in particulates and less production of 14CO2, suggesting that GBT may be used as an osmolyte by microorganisms. Uptake, retention, and degradation patterns were similar in {\textless}0.8-$\mu$m filtrates and whole seawater, and size fractionation experiments showed that most GBT uptake was by organisms of {\textless}1 $\mu$m, suggesting bacteria as the microbes most likely responsible for GBT uptake. Uptake rates followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with saturation at {\textless}20 nM added GBT in most cases and K(t) + S(n) values ranging from 1.2 to 49 nM. Turnover times for S(n) were short, ranging from 0.52 to 11 h.

GBT uptake displayed temperature optima from 20°C to 30°C, with optima close to the in situ temperature on the day of sample collection. Together, the results indicate that nanomolar levels of GBT are rapidly scavenged by seawater microorganisms for use as an osmolyte or carbon and energy source. The relative proportion of retention vs. degradation is likely to depend on the composition of the microbial community and environmental factors such as osmotic stress and the availability of alternative osmotic or carbon and energy substrates.},

SAR11, a ubiquitous clade of very small and highly abundant Alphaproteobacteria, are known to devote much of their energy to synthesizing ATP-binding cassette periplasmic proteins that bind substrates. We hypothesized that their small size and relatively large periplasmic space might enable them to outcompete other bacterioplankton for nutrients. Using uptake experiments with 14C-glycine betaine, we discovered that two strains of SAR11, Candidatus Pelagibacter sp. HTCC7211 and Cand. P. ubique HTCC1062, have extraordinarily high affinity for glycine betaine (GBT), with half-saturation (Ks) values around 1 nM and specific affinity values between 8 and 14 L mg cell−1 h−1. Competitive inhibition studies indicated that the GBT transporters in these strains are multifunctional, transporting multiple substrates in addition to GBT. Both strains could use most of the transported compounds for metabolism and ATP production. Our findings indicate that Pelagibacter cells are primarily responsible for the high affinity and multifunctional GBT uptake systems observed in seawater. Maximization of whole-cell affinities may enable these organisms to compete effectively for nutrients during periods when the gross transport capacity of the heterotrophic plankton community exceeds the supply, depressing ambient concentrations.},

Microbiol. 136:2527-2535, 1990). We found, however, that B. subtilis can synthesize glycine betaine when its biosynthetic precursor, choline, is present in the growth medium. Uptake studies with radiolabelled [methyl-14C]choline demonstrated that choline transport is osmotically controlled and is mediated by a high-affinity uptake system. Choline transport of cells grown in low- and high-osmolarity media showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km values of 3 and 5 microM and maximum rates of transport (Vmax) of 10 and 36 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, respectively. The choline transporter exhibited considerable substrate specificity, and the results of competition experiments suggest that the fully methylated quaternary ammonium group is a key feature for substrate recognition. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the radioactivity from exogenously provided [methyl-14C]choline accumulated intracellularly as [methyl-14C]glycine betaine, demonstrating that B. subtilis possesses enzymes for the oxidative conversion of choline into glycine betaine. Exogenously provided choline significantly increased the growth rate of B. subtilis in high-osmolarity media and permitted its proliferation under conditions that are otherwise strongly inhibitory for its growth. Choline and glycine betaine were not used as sole sources of carbon or nitrogen, consistent with their functional role in the process of adaptation of B. subtilis to high-osmolarity stress.},

The DNA sequence of a 2,310-bp segment of the cloned region revealed a single gene (opuD) whose product (OpuD) was essential for glycine betaine uptake and osmoprotection in E. coli. The opuD gene encodes a hydrophobic 56.13-kDa protein (512 amino acid residues). OpuD shows a significant degree of sequence identity to the choline transporter BetT and the carnitine transporter CaiT from E. coli and a BetT-like protein from Haemophilus influenzae. These membrane proteins form a family of transporters involved in the uptake of trimethylammonium compounds. The OpuD-mediated glycine betaine transport activity in B. subtilis is controlled by the environmental osmolarity. High osmolarity stimulates de novo synthesis of OpuD and activates preexisting OpuD proteins to achieve maximal glycine betaine uptake activity. An opuD mutant was constructed by marker replacement, and the OpuD-mediated glycine betaine uptake activity was compared with that of the previously identified multicomponent OpuA and OpuC (ProU) glycine betaine uptake systems. In addition, a set of mutants was constructed, each of which synthesized only one of the three glycine betaine uptake systems. These mutants were used to determine the kinetic parameters for glycine betaine transport through OpuA, OpuC, and OpuD. Each of these uptake systems shows high substrate affinity, with K(m) values in the low micromolar range, which should allow B. subtilis to efficiently acquire the osmoprotectant from the environment. The systems differed in their contribution to the overall glycine betaine accumulation and osmoprotection. A triple opuA, opuC, and opuD mutant strain was isolated, and it showed no glycine betaine uptake activity, demonstrating that three transport systems for this osmoprotectant operate in B. subtilis.},

   abstract = {Fluctuations in osmolarity are one of the most prevalent stresses to which bacteria must adapt, both hypo- and hyperosmotic conditions. Most bacteria cope with high osmolarity by accumulating compatible solutes (osmolytes) in the cytoplasm to maintain the turgor pressure of the cell. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a halophile, utilizes at least six compatible solute transporters for the uptake of osmolytes: two ABC family ProU transporters and four betaine-carnitine-choline transporter (BCCT) family transporters. The full range of compatible solutes transported by this species has yet to be determined. Using an osmolyte phenotypic microarray plate for growth analyses, we expanded the known osmolytes used by V. parahaemolyticus to include N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG), among others. Growth pattern analysis of four triple-bccT mutants, possessing only one functional BCCT, indicated that BccT1 (VP1456), BccT2 (VP1723), and BccT3 (VP1905) transported DMG. BccT1 was unusual in that it could take up both compounds with methylated head groups (glycine betaine [GB], choline, and DMG) and cyclic compounds (ectoine and proline). Bioinformatics analysis identified the four coordinating amino acid residues for GB in the BccT1 protein. In silico modeling analysis demonstrated that GB, DMG, and ectoine docked in the same binding pocket in BccT1. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that a strain with all four residues mutated resulted in the loss of uptake of GB, DMG, and ectoine. We showed that three of the four residues were essential for ectoine uptake, whereas only one of the residues was important for GB uptake. Overall, we have demonstrated that DMG is a highly effective compatible solute for Vibrio species and have elucidated the amino acid residues in BccT1 that are important for the coordination of GB, DMG, and ectoine transport. IMPORTANCE Vibrio parahaemolyticus possesses at least six osmolyte transporters, which allow the bacterium to adapt to high-salinity conditions. In this study, we identified several additional osmolytes that were utilized by V. parahaemolyticus. We demonstrated that the compound DMG, which is present in the marine environment, was a highly effective osmolyte for Vibrio species. We determined that DMG is transported via BCCT family carriers, which have not been shown previously to take up this compound. BccT1 was a carrier for GB, DMG, and ectoine, and we identified the amino acid residues essential for the coordination of these compounds. The data suggest that for BccT1, GB is more easily accommodated than ectoine in the transporter binding pocket.},

abstract = {The quantitative significance of the nitrogenous compound glycine betaine (GBT) and its sulfur analog dimelhylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to intracellular pools in marine phytoplankton is not well known. In a series of experiments conducted in August 1993, we measured these compounds, as well as total organic sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen, over the growth cycle in six isolates of marine phytoplankton, Amphidinium car ferae Hulburt, Chrysocromulina sp. Lackey, Emiliania huxleyi Hay et Mohler, Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve, and Tetraselmis sp. At the same time, we measured cellular concentrations of protein, amino acids, chlorophyll, and inorganic nutrients. All six species produced DMSP, while three produced GET at lesser levels. In the Chrysochromulina sp. isolate, levels of GET were greater than DMSP during the exponential phase of growth, but declined sharply as the culture approached stationary phase. This change appeared to coincide with the onset of nitrogen limitation. Other nitrogenous osmolytes were produced in five of the six species but in much smaller quantities. DMSP contributed significantly to cellular sulfur throughout the growth cycle although, in some algae, the proportion of dissolved DMSP increased substantially during stationary growth. When present, GET formed a sizeable fraction of the cellular nitrogen only during exponential growth. A significant percentage (ca. 50{\%}) of the organic nitrogen could not be accounted for even when cellular pools of protein, amino acids, inorganic nitrogen, and nitrogenous osmolytes were combined. Based on these experiments, there does not appear to be a reciprocal relationship between DMSP and GET production, although GET production does appear to be correlated with nitrogen availability.},

In this study, we examined the role of small zwitterionic metabolites in the osmoadaption of two common microalgae species Emiliania huxleyi and Prorocentrum minimum. By cultivation of the algae under salinities between 16‰ and 38‰ and subsequent analysis of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), glycine betaine (GBT), gonyol, homarine, trigonelline, dimethylsulfonioacetate, trimethylammonium propionate, and trimethylammonium butyrate using HPLC-MS, we could reveal two fundamentally different osmoadaption mechanisms. While E. huxleyi responded with cell size reduction and a nearly constant ratio between the major metabolites DMSP, GBT and homarine to increasing salinity, osmolyte composition of P. minimum changed dramatically. In this alga DMSP concentration remained nearly constant at 18.6 mM between 20‰ and 32‰ but the amount of GBT and dimethylsulfonioacetate increased from 4{\%} to 30{\%} of total investigated osmolytes. Direct quantification of zwitterionic metabolites via LC-MS is a powerful tool to unravel the complex osmoadaption and regulation mechanisms of marine phytoplankton.},

The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

abstract = {Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives, polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called ;compatible solutes', a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine), providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulfide (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast, and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules, perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic fibrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

Polyhydric alcohols, free amino acids and their derivatives, and combinations of urea and methylamines are the three types of osmolyte systems found in all water-stressed organisms except the halobacteria. The selective advantages of the organic osmolyte systems are, first, a compatibility with macromolecular structure and function at high or variable (or both) osmolyte concentrations, and, second, greatly reduced needs for modifying proteins to function in concentrated intracellular solutions. Osmolyte compatibility is proposed to result from the absence of osmolyte interactions with substrates and cofactors, and the nonperturbing or favorable effects of osmolytes on macromolecular-solvent interactions.},

However, the extent of the coupling between taurine production and consumption over a seasonal cycle has not been examined yet. We determined taurine production by abundant crustacean zooplankton and its role as a carbon and energy source for several prokaryotic taxa in the northern Adriatic Sea over a seasonal cycle. Taurine concentrations were generally in the low nanomolar range, reaching a maximum of 22 nmol L−1 in fall during a Pseudonitzschia bloom and coinciding with the highest zooplankton taurine release rates. Taurine accounted for up to 5{\%} of the carbon, 11{\%} of the nitrogen, and up to 71{\%} of the sulfur requirements of heterotrophic prokaryotes. Members of the Roseobacter clade, Alteromonas, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota exhibited higher cell-specific taurine assimilation rates than SAR11 cells. However, cell-specific taurine and leucine assimilation were highly variable in all taxa, suggesting species and/or ecotype specific utilization patterns of taurine and dissolved free amino acids. Copepods were able to cover the bulk taurine requirements of the prokaryotic communities in fall and winter and partly in the spring–summer period. Overall, our study emphasizes the significance of taurine as a carbon and energy source for the prokaryotic community in the northern Adriatic Sea and the importance of crustacean zooplankton as a significant source of taurine and other organic compounds for the heterotrophic prokaryotic community.},

abstract = {Ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine are widely synthesized microbial osmostress protectants. They are also versatile nutrients but their catabolism and the genetic regulation of the corresponding genes are incompletely understood. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, we investigated the utilization of ectoines and propose a seven steps comprising catabolic route that entails an initial conversion of 5-hydroxyectoine to ectoine, the opening of the ectoine ring, and the subsequent degradation of this intermediate to L-aspartate. The catabolic genes are co-transcribed with three genes encoding a 5-hydroxyectoine/ectoine-specific TRAP transporter. A chromosomal deletion of this entire gene cluster abolishes the utilization of ectoines as carbon and nitrogen sources. The presence of ectoines in the growth medium triggers enhanced expression of the importer and catabolic operon, a process dependent on a substrate-inducible promoter that precedes this gene cluster. EnuR, a member of the MocR/GabR-type transcriptional regulators, controls the activity of this promoter and functions as a repressor. EnuR contains a covalently bound pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, and we suggest that this co-factor is critical for the substrate-mediated induction of the 5-hydroxyectoine/ectoine import and catabolic genes. Bioinformatics showed that ectoine consumers are restricted to the Proteobacteria and that EnuR is likely a central regulator for most ectoine/5-hydroxyectoine catabolic genes.

First there is a brief consideration of the possibility of active water transport into plant xylem in the generation of root pressure and the refilling of embolized xylem elements, and from an unsaturated atmosphere into terrestrial organisms living in habitats with limited availability of liquid water. There is then a more detailed consideration of volume and osmotic regulation in wall-less freshwater unicells, and the possibility of generation of buoyancy in marine phytoplankton such as large-celled diatoms. Calculations show that active water transport is a plausible mechanism to assist cells in upwards vertical movements, requires less energy than synthesis of low-density organic solutes, and potentially on a par with excluding certain ions from the vacuole.},

This raises the possibility that phytoplankton could synthesize the denser organic solute DMSP in low nutrient oceanic surface waters facilitating sinking into zones of the euphotic zone richer in nutrients and maximizing their growth, hereafter referred to the "DMSP-ballast" hypothesis. The objective of this study was to test the DMSP-ballast hypothesis by modeling the sinking rates of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and two strains of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi as a function of DMSP synthesis in nitrogen-limited conditions. We also explored the potential ballast effect of DMSP in the positively buoyant non-motile algal species Ethmodiscus rex and Pyrocystis noctiluca. The model results suggest that replacement of trimethylammonium and GBT by DMSP in the naked E. huxleyi strain and T. pseudonana grown under nitrogen limitation could increase the sinking rate by 1-22{\%}; while a putative increase in DMSP synthesis (in the millimolar range) in E. rex and P. noctiluca could decrease the rising rate by 43{\%} to several orders of magnitude. The present study suggests a potential ballast role for DMSP in phytoplankton.},

abstract = {The occurrence of active water transport (net transport against a free energy gradient) in photosynthetic organisms has been debated for several decades. Here, active water transport is considered in terms of its roles, where it is found, and the mechanisms by which it could occur. First there is a brief consideration of the possibility of active water transport into plant xylem in the generation of root pressure and the refilling of embolized xylem elements, and from an unsaturated atmosphere into terrestrial organisms living in habitats with limited availability of liquid water. There is then a more detailed consideration of volume and osmotic regulation in wall-less freshwater unicells, and the possibility of generation of buoyancy in marine phytoplankton such as large-celled diatoms. Calculations show that active water transport is a plausible mechanism to assist cells in upwards vertical movements, requires less energy than synthesis of low-density organic solutes, and potentially on a par with excluding certain ions from the vacuole.},

abstract = {Marine phytoplanktonic cells can achieve neutral buoyancy only if the excess density of their relatively heavy structural materials (proteins, carbohydrates, silicate) is compensated for by the incorporation of materials that have densities less than seawater. We have calculated densities and osmotic concentrations for several marine algae, based on published values of structural materials and concentrations of inorganic ions and other osmolytes. The calculations, incorporating the partial molal volume, molecular mass, concentrations and osmotic coefficients, indicate that most published listings of intracellular osmolytes in marine algae are insufficient to provide the turgor known to exist. Similarly, the density of phytoplanktonic cells, calculated on the basis of known or estimated concentrations of cellular components, generally exceeds the density of seawater, which would cause negative buoyancy (sinking) throughout. We use models of osmotic concentration and cellular density in which we supplement known concentrations of osmolytes with proxy osmolytes. In particular, concentrations of some 100 mol m–3 of quaternary ammonium derivatives can explain the deficits of both osmotic concentration and buoyancy.},

abstract = {Light is the primary input of energy into the sunlit ocean, driving daily oscillations in metabolism of primary producers. The consequences of this solar forcing have implications for the whole microbial community, yet in situ measurements of metabolites, direct products of cellular activity, over the diel cycle are scarce. We evaluated community-level biochemical consequences of diel oscillations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre by quantifying 79 metabolites in particulate organic matter in surface waters every four hours over eight days. Total particulate metabolite concentration peaked at dusk, even when normalized to biomass estimates. The concentrations of 70{\%} of individual metabolites exhibited 24-hour periodicity. Despite the diverse organisms that use them, primary metabolites involved in anabolic processes and redox maintenance had significant 24-hour periodicity. Osmolytes exhibited the largest diel oscillations, implying rapid turnover and metabolic roles beyond cell turgor maintenance. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed the taxa involved in production and consumption of some metabolites, including the osmolyte trehalose. This compound displayed the largest diel oscillations in abundance and was likely produced by the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera for energy storage. These findings demonstrate that paired measurements of particulate metabolites and transcripts resolve strategies microbes use to manage daily energy and redox oscillations. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {An understanding of the quality and accuracy of state-of-the-art time-varying salinity information is being established by comparing existing products against each other as well as against existing ocean reanalyzes and satellite retrieval. The focus the paper is on large-scale salinity structures and their temporal variations from the sea surface down to 700 m depth. Uncertainties are quantified through the spread between all existing estimates on various time scales including long-term trends. Results suggest that uncertainties of time mean climatological salinity estimates are as large as 0.3 within the first 50 m of high vertical salinity gradients and even larger in some boundary regions. Over the open (deep) ocean, a near-surface spread of 0.1 can be observed; below 300 m depth it stays below 0.03 over most part of the world ocean. Measuring salinity in near-costal and highly dynamic regions remains problematic and calls for a better integration of existing in situ and satellite capabilities there. There remain challenges in estimating the amplitude of the salinity seasonal cycle from the existing in situ database. This holds especially within the tropics, where the disagreement between the seasonal salinity amplitude estimated from individual situ data sets is typically around 30{\%}, locally even up to 50{\%}. Regarding interannual and longer-term salinity changes, inferred trend patterns agree well with the standard deviation of the decadal climatologies, suggesting that it remains difficult to obtain statistically significant estimates of long-term trends from the existing short data base over the world ocean. Overall, our results call for further improvements of ocean reanalysis products and their expanded use in studies of ocean variability and changes in the future.},

ABSTRACT={Particulate organic matter (POM) (fecal pellets) from zooplankton has been demonstrated to be an important nutrient source for the pelagic prokaryotic community. Significantly less is known about the chemical composition of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by these eukaryotes and its influence on pelagic ecosystem structure. Zooplankton migrators, which daily transport surface-derived compounds to depth, may act as important vectors of limiting nutrients for mesopelagic microbial communities. In this role, zooplankton may increase the DOM remineralization rate by heterotrophic prokaryotes through the creation of nutrient rich “hot spots” that could potentially increase niche diversity. To explore these interactions, we collected the migratory copepod Pleuromamma xiphias from the northwestern Sargasso Sea and sampled its excreta after 12–16 h of incubation. We measured bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) via high performance liquid chromatography and dissolved targeted metabolites via quantitative mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MSMS) to quantify organic zooplankton excreta production and characterize its composition. We observed production of labile DOM, including amino acids, vitamins, and nucleosides. Additionally, we harvested a portion of the excreta and subsequently used it as the growth medium for mesopelagic (200 m) bacterioplankton dilution cultures. In zooplankton excreta treatments we observed a four-fold increase in bacterioplankton cell densities that reached stationary growth phase after five days of dark incubation. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicons suggested a shift from oligotrophs typical of open ocean and mesopelagic prokaryotic communities to more copiotrophic bacterial lineages in the presence of zooplankton excreta. These results support the hypothesis that zooplankton and prokaryotes are engaged in complex and indirect ecological interactions, broadening our understanding of the microbial loop.}

abstract = {Summary Characterisation of marine copepod gut microbiome composition and its variability provides information on function of marine food webs, biogeochemical cycles and copepod health. Copepod gut microbiomes were investigated quarterly over two years at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, while assessing seasonal shifts in stable and transient communities. Microbial communities were analysed using amplicon sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA V3-V4 region and the cyanobacterial ntcA gene. Persistent bacterial groups belonging to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were present in the copepod guts throughout the year, and showed synchronous changes, suggesting a link to variability in copepod nutritional content. The gut communities were separate from those in the seawater, suggesting the copepod gut hosts long-term, specialized communities. Major temporal variations in the gut communities during the early winter and spring, specifically a high relative abundance of Synechococcus (up to 65\%), were attributed to bacterioplankton shifts in the water column, and copepod grazing on these picoplanktonic cyanobacteria. The presence of obligate and facultative anaerobes, including Clostridiales year round, suggests that anaerobic bacterial processes are common in these dynamic microhabitats in the oligotrophic open ocean.},

Here we show that an abundant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, contributes a variety of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-containing compounds to dissolved organic matter. A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics and genomic tools was used to characterize the intracellular and extracellular metabolites of S. elongatus. Aromatic compounds, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylalanine, as well as nucleosides (e.g. thymidine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, xanthosine), the organosulfur compound 3-mercaptopropionate, and the plant auxin indole 3-acetic acid, were released by S. elongatus at multiple time points during its growth. Further, the amino acid kynurenine was found to accumulate in the media even though it was not present in the predicted metabolome of S. elongatus. This indicates that some metabolites, including those not predicted by an organism's genome, are likely excreted into the environment as waste; however, these molecules may have broader ecological relevance if they are labile to nearby microbes. The compounds described herein provide excellent targets for quantitative analysis in field settings to assess the source and lability of dissolved organic matter in situ.},

abstract = {Bacillus subtilis is known to accumulate large amounts of the compatible solute proline via de novo synthesis as a stress protectant when it faces high-salinity environments. We elucidated the genetic determinants required for the osmoadaptive proline production from the precursor glutamate. This proline biosynthesis route relies on the proJ-encoded $\gamma$-glutamyl kinase, the proA-encoded $\gamma$-glutamyl phosphate reductase, and the proH-encoded $\Delta$1-pyrroline-5-caboxylate reductase. Disruption of the proHJ operon abolished osmoadaptive proline production and strongly impaired the ability of B. subtilis to cope with high-osmolarity growth conditions. Disruption of the proA gene also abolished osmoadaptive proline biosynthesis but caused, in contrast to the disruption of proHJ, proline auxotrophy. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the transcription of the proHJ operon is osmotically inducible, whereas that of the proBA operon is not. Reporter gene fusion studies showed that proHJ expression is rapidly induced upon an osmotic upshift. Increased expression is maintained as long as the osmotic stimulus persists and is sensitively linked to the prevalent osmolarity of the growth medium. Primer extension analysis revealed the osmotically controlled proHJ promoter, a promoter that resembles typical SigA-type promoters of B. subtilis. Deletion analysis of the proHJ promoter region identified a 126-bp DNA segment carrying all sequences required in cis for osmoregulated transcription. Our data disclose the presence of ProA-interlinked anabolic and osmoadaptive proline biosynthetic routes in B. subtilis and demonstrate that the synthesis of the compatible solute proline is a central facet of the cellular defense to high-osmolarity surroundings for this soil bacterium.},

	abstract = {Metabolites, or the small organic molecules that are synthesized by cells during metabolism, comprise a complex and dynamic pool of carbon in the ocean. They are an essential form of information, linking genotype to phenotype at the individual, population and community levels of biological organization. Characterizing metabolite distributions inside microbial cells and dissolved in seawater is essential to understanding the controls on their production and fate, as well as their roles in shaping marine microbial food webs. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics method to quantify particulate and dissolved distributions of a suite of biologically relevant metabolites including vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, osmolytes, and intermediates in biosynthetic pathways along a latitudinal transect in the western Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in the euphotic zone, most particulate or intracellular metabolites positively co-vary with the most abundant microbial taxa. In contrast, dissolved metabolites exhibited greater variability with differences in distribution between ocean regions. Although fewer particulate metabolites were detected below the euphotic zone, molecules identified in the deep ocean may be linked to preservation of organic matter or adaptive physiological strategies of deep-sea microbes. Based on the identified metabolite distributions, we propose relationships between certain metabolites and microbial populations, and find that dissolved metabolite distributions are not directly related to their particulate abundances.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {1,4,5,6-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid (ectoine) is an excellent osmoprotectant. The biosynthetic pathway of ectoine from aspartic $\beta$-semialdehyde (ASA), in Halomonas elongata, was elucidated by purification and characterization of each enzyme involved. 2,4-Diaminobutyrate (DABA) aminotransferase catalyzed reversively the first step of the pathway, conversion of ASA to DABA by transamination with L-glutamate. This enzyme required pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and potassium ions for its activity and stability. The gel filtration estimated an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa, whereas molecular mass measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was 44 kDa. This enzyme exhibited an optimum pH of 8.6 and an optimum temperature of 25°C and had K(m)s of 9.1 mM for L- glutamate and 4.5 mM for DL-ASA. DABA acetyltransferase catalyzed acetylation of DABA to $\gamma$-N-acetyl-$\alpha$, $\gamma$-diaminobutyric acid (ADABA) with acetyl coenzyme A and exhibited an optimum pH of 8.2 and an optimum temperature of 20°C in the presence of 0.4 M NaCl. The molecular mass was 45 kDa by gel filtration. Ectoine synthase catalyzed circularization of ADABA to ectoine and exhibited an optimum pH of 8.5 to 9.0 and an optimum temperature of 15°C in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. This enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa by SDS-PAGE and a K(m) of 8.4 mM in the presence of 0.77 M NaCl. DABA acetyltransferase and ectoine synthase were stabilized in the presence of NaCl ({\textgreater}2 M) and DABA (100 mM) at temperatures below 30°C.},

abstract = {Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophile present in marine and estuarine environments, ecosystems characterized by fluctuations in salinity and temperature. One strategy to thrive in such environments is the synthesis and/or uptake of compatible solutes. The V. parahaemolyticus genome contains biosynthesis systems for both ectoine and glycine betaine, which are known to act as compatible solutes in other species. We showed that V. parahaemolyticus had a 6{\%}NaCl tolerance when grown in M9 minimal medium with 0.4{\%} glucose (M9G) with a{\textgreater}5-h lag phase. By using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) analysis, we determined that cells synthesized ectoine and glutamate in a NaCl-dependent manner. The most effective compatible solutes as measured by a reduction in lag-phase growth in M9G with 6{\%} NaCl (M9G 6{\%} NaCl) were in the order glycine betaine {\textgreater} choline {\textgreater} proline = glutamate {\textgreater} ectoine. However, V. parahaemolyticus could use glutamate or proline as the sole carbon source, but not ectoine or glycine betaine, which suggests that these are bona fide compatible solutes. Expression analysis showed that the ectA and betA genes were more highly expressed in log-phase cells, and expression of both genes was induced by NaCl up-shock. Under all conditions examined, the ectA gene was more highly expressed than the betA gene. Analysis of inframe deletions in betA and ectB and in a double mutant showed that the ectB mutant was defective for growth, and this defect was rescued by the addition of glycine betaine, proline, ectoine, and glutamate, indicating that these compounds are compatible solutes for this species. The presence of both synthesis systems was the predominant distribution pattern among members of the Vibrionaceae family, suggesting this is the ancestral state. {\textcopyright} 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract = {Estuarine habitats contribute disproportionately as nursery habitats for marine fish, yet are amongst the most anthropogenically degraded ecosystems on Earth. Juvenile fish growing in urbanised estuarine habitats are subject to a mosaic of stressors, thus development of higher resolution methods to gain a more complete assessment of fish responses is vital. Accordingly, this study provides the first assessment of metabolomic profiling as a new bioindicator of habitat quality for juvenile fish. We matched traditional bioindicator methods (fish growth rates) with metabolomic profiles in juvenile snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), a culturally and commercially important species across Australia and New Zealand. Juvenile snapper were collected from, and within, harbour sites occupying a gradient in turbidity, a significant stressor for this species that is known to result in reduced weight, mortality and deleterious physiological responses. We found that fish growth assessed using otolith increments was not reflective of the turbidity gradient with little discrimination among sites. However, metabolomic profiling was highly sensitive and reproducible, with 100{\%} accuracy in discriminating fish from harbours with differing turbidity. These differences in metabolic profiles were largely driven by metabolites and pathways involved in energy production, processes of growth, or the immune response. In particular, the amino acids Cysteine and 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA), linked to growth and development in snapper, were elevated in juveniles from more pristine harbours, and offer promising candidates for use as a biomarker of habitat quality in this species. Thus, we show that metabolomic approaches can uncover site differences that traditional and more coarse methods were unable to detect. This work provides a novel baseline for the use of metabolomic profiling on wild-caught snapper to inform management and conservation decisions, with the potential to identify biomarkers reflective of habitat quality.},

abstract = {Abstract Bacteria isolated from sea‐water grew on putrescine and spermidine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, but not on cadaverine. Cell suspensions of one isolate (PU‐8) produced gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) from putrescine in 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.33 M NaCl and 15 mM MgCl2, and three other isolates produced the inducer when gabaculine (a natural inhibitor of GABA metabolism) was added. None of the isolates produced GABA from spermidine either in the absence or presence of gabaculine. Yields of GABA from putrescine were low in the suspension fluid and near stoichiometric quantities could only be obtained by extraction of incubations with methanol. Decreased NaCl ({\textless} 0.05 M) or increased pH resulted in an increase of GABA released into the suspension fluid during incubations, although in growth cultures only pH appeared to have a substantial effect. GABA release was not influenced by temperature in the range 17 to 32°C. Replacement of the normal concentration of NaCl (0.33 M) with equivalent LiCl, sodium glucuronate, or sucrose in cell suspensions did not result in increased GABA in the suspension fluid, indicating non‐involvement of a sodium or chloride ion‐dependent transport system in GABA release. The results show that marine bacteria can produce GABA, an inducer of marine invertebrate larval settlement, and indicate that extenal changes in osmotic pressure and pH which influence GABA release may be important factors to consider in the production of this inducer.

abstract = {Different bacterial species and, particularly Pseudomonas fluorescens, can produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and express GABA-binding proteins. In this study, we investigated the effect of GABA on the virulence and biofilm formation activity of different strains of P. fluorescens. Exposure of a psychotropic strain of P. fluorescens (MF37) to GABA (10-5 M) increased its necrotic-like activity on eukaryotic (glial) cells, but reduced its apoptotic effect. Conversely, muscimol and bicuculline, the selective agonist and antagonist of eukaryote GABAA receptors, respectively, were ineffective. P. fluorescens MF37 did not produce biosurfactants, and its caseinase, esterase, amylase, hemolytic activity or pyoverdine productions were unchanged. In contrast, the effect of GABA was associated to rearrangements of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure, particularly in the lipid A region. The surface hydrophobicity of MF37 was marginally modified, and GABA reduced its biofilm formation activity on PVC, but not on glass, although the initial adhesion was increased. Five other P. fluorescens strains were studied, and only one, MFP05, a strain isolated from human skin, showed structural differences of biofilm maturation after exposure to GABA. These results reveal that GABA can regulate the LPS structure and cytotoxicity of P. fluorescens, but that this property is specific to some strains. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Nearly one third of bacterial isolates from surfaces suitable for abalone (Haliotis) settlement were able to grow on GABA as sole carbon source. Compared with similar compounds, GABA was a good source of carbon, nitrogen and energy, and it was utilized concomitantly with glucose. GABA-metabolizing enzymes were constitutive in Pseudomonas fluorescens and inducible in Aeromonas hydrophila. High-affinity (Km: 20-50 $\mu$M) and low-affinity (Km: 7-9 mM) uptake systems were produced in response to low and high GABA concentrations, respectively, in the growth medium. Within the ecologically significant temperature range (12-24°C), specific GABA degradation rates varied 2.5-fold in young cells of P. fluorescens. This organism los its ability to degrade GABA during the stationary phase. The results suggest that marine bacteria have the potential to affect invertebrate larval settlement by removing GABA from the settlement habitat. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {We compared levels of the major organic osmolytes in the muscle of elasmobranchs, including the methylamines trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and sarcosine as well as the $\beta$-amino acids taurine and $\beta$-alanine, and the activities of enzymes of methylamine synthesis (betaine and TMAO) in species with a wide range of urea contents. Four marine, a euryhaline in freshwater (Dasyatis sabina), and two freshwater species, one that accumulates urea (Himantura signifer) and one that does not (Potamotrygon motoro), were analyzed. Urea contents in muscle ranged from 229-352 $\mu$mol g-1 in marine species to 2.0 $\mu$mol g-1 in P. motoro. Marine elasmobranchs preferentially accumulate methylamines, possibly to counteract urea effects on macromolecules, whereas the freshwater species with lower urea levels accumulate the $\beta$-amino acid taurine as the major non-urea osmolyte. A strong correlation (r2=0.84, P{\textless}0.001) with a slope of 0.40 was found between muscle urea content and the combined total methylamines plus total $\beta$-amino acids, supporting the hypothesis that 'non-urea' osmolytes are specifically maintained at an approximately 2:1 ratio with urea in the muscle of elasmobranchs. All species examined had measurable synthetic capacity for betaine in the liver but only one species had detectable TMAO synthetic capacity. We propose a phylogenetic explanation for the distribution of TMAO synthesis in elasmobranchs and suggest that activation of liver betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, relative to choline dehydrogenase, coincides with betaine accumulation in elasmobranchs. The latter relationship may be important in maintaining methylamine levels during periods of low dietary TMAO intake for species lacking TMAO synthesis.},

It was shown that all these substances stabilize the protein structure against thermal denaturation and (except for trimethylamine N-oxide for which interaction measurements could not be made) are strongly excluded from the protein domain, rendering unlikely their direct binding to proteins. On the other hand, valine, not known as an osmolyte, had no stabilizing effect, although it induced a large protein-preferential hydration.

abstract = {Compatible solutes are small organic molecules that are involved in the acclimation to various stresses such as temperature and salinity. Marine or moderate halotolerant cyanobacteria accumulate glucosylglycerol, while cyanobacteria with low salt tolerance (freshwater strains) usually accumulate sucrose or trehalose as the main compatible solutes. The screening of the genome of the marine, unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 revealed that instead of genes for glucosylglycerol biosynthesis, a fusion protein for the synthesis of trehalose was found that displayed similarities to trehalose-phosphate-synthase and -phosphatase (OtsAB pathway) from enterobacteria. Accordingly, cells of Crocosphaera showed salt-stimulated expression of the otsAB gene as well as a salt-dependent trehalose accumulation. The biochemical characterization of recombinant full-length OtsAB and truncated OtsB versions revealed that the otsAB gene in Crocosphaera encodes for an active trehalose-phosphate-synthase/phosphatase fusion protein. Genes coding for such proteins were not found in the genomes of other cyanobacteria but were present in many other, non-related marine bacteria, suggesting that otsAB might have been acquired by lateral gene transfer into the Crocosphaera genome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of integration data demonstrated that wild and SCC showed profound biochemical changes including glutathione metabolism, glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism in wild, while SCC caused signification variations in citric acid metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation related pathways respectively. Random forest analysis showed top 15 metabolites and their correct classification. Present findings provide baseline information on H. pinifolia metabolism in the marine and artificial environments.

Here, we used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a targeted metabolomics approach to study the adaptations of Sulfurimonas denitrificans to varying salt concentrations that are found in its natural habitat of tidal mudflats. Proline was identified as one of the most abundant internal metabolites and its concentration showed a strong positive correlation with ionic strength, suggesting that it acts as an important osmolyte in S. denitrificans. 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate was also positively correlated with ionic strength, indicating it might play a previously unrecognized role in osmoregulation. Furthermore, the detection of metabolites from the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle at high internal concentrations reinforces the importance of this pathway for carbon fixation in Campylobacteria and as a hub for biosynthesis. As the first report of metabolomic data for an campylobacterial chemolithoautotroph, this study provides data that will be useful to understand the adaptations of Campylobacteria to their natural habitat at redox interfaces.},

abstract = {Living cells employ various defence mechanisms against reactive oxygen species and free radicals. Besides protecting enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules also play an important role as radical scavengers. Within bacteria the amino acid derivative ectoine (2-methyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylate) is the most abundant compatible solute and stress protectant. Although this compound is already produced commercially for applications as moisturizer and skin-care product, it has been a matter of debate whether ectoine also has radical-scavenging activity. Here we report on its hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in comparison to other compatible solutes and describe the reaction products obtained when ectoine is exposed to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction. In a sodium salicylate scavenging test system this compatible solute performed as well as mannitol. As a consequence of its reaction with hydroxyl radicals, ectoine was converted into two major products: N-acetimide aspartate and N-acetimide-$\beta$-alanine. We propose a reaction mechanism in which the heterocycle of the compatible solute ectoine is cleaved and further oxidized at the C-terminus. The proven radical scavenging ability of ectoine will help to explain observed effects as anti-inflammatory compound in skin, lung and bowel disease.},

To re-establish the essential turgor pressure, cells increase the water activity of their cytoplasm by accumulation of compatible solutes, either by synthesis or by uptake. The ability to respond to increasing osmolality is well conserved in all three lines of descent and, here, we compare the osmoadaptive strategies of Bacteria and Archaea. The temporal sequence of events after an osmotic upshock will be discussed, with a focus on the most rapid response, notably the mechanisms of transport activation at the protein level, and different signals for osmolality will be compared. The spectrum of compatible solutes used by different organisms is rather diverse and a comparison of 'bacterial' and 'archaeal' compatible solutes will be given.},

   abstract = {The nutritionally versatile and naturally competent soil bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi copes with salt stress by the accumulation of compatible solutes. NMR analyses revealed that cells amassed glutamate and the rather unusual sugar alcohol mannitol upon an increase of the external NaCl concentration. To unravel the path of mannitol biosynthesis, the genome was inspected for genes potentially involved in its biosynthesis. A gene encoding a potential mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (mtlD) was identified in the genome of A. baylyi. Expression of mtlD was highly induced at high salinity. mtlD was overexpressed and the purified protein indeed produced mannitol-1-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate. The enzyme preferred NADPH over NADH and the specific activity of fructose-6-phosphate reduction with NADPH was 130 U mg-1. Enzymatic activity was strictly salt-dependent. Deletion of mtlD resulted in a complete loss of salt-dependent manni-tol biosynthesis. We provide clear evidence that osmo-induced synthesis of the compatible solute mannitol is by a two-step pathway and that the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase mediating the first step of this pathway is regulated by salinity on the transcriptional as well as on the activity level.},

   abstract = {Cells of marine species are known to establish osmotic balance with their environment by adjusting the concentrations of organic osmolytes rather than inorganic osmolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. These organic osmolytes fall into three classes: polyhydric alcohols such as sorbitol, amino acids and amino acid derivatives, and urea and trimethylamines. Substantial evidence is available for a central role of each of these classes in osmoregulation in marine species. In this chapter information on the importance of organic osmolytes is extended to a study of isolated mammalian kidney cells. The intracellular concentration of organic osmolytes in these cells responds dramatically to changes in the osmotic environment. The release of sorbitol following hypoosmotic exposure appears to be triggered by calcium, possibly via a mechanism involving membrane recycling. The summarized experiments provide a basis for further work in marine species. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

Using a targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach, we found that axenic cultures of the Antarctic sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei, displayed large differences in their metabolomes when grown in a matrix of conditions that included temperatures of -1 and 4°C, and salinities of 32 and 41, despite relatively small changes in growth rate. Temperature exerted a greater effect than salinity on cellular metabolite pool sizes, though the N- or S-containing compatible solutes, 2, 3-dihydroxypro-pane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), glycine betaine (GBT), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and proline responded strongly to both temperature and salinity, suggesting complexity in their control. We saw the largest (> 4-fold) response to salinity for proline. DHPS, a rarely studied but potential compatible solute, had the highest intracellular concentrations among all compatible solutes of ~85 mM. When comparing the culture findings to natural Arctic sea-ice diatom communities, we found extensive overlap in metabolite profiles, highlighting the relevance of culture-based studies to probe environmental questions. Large changes in sea-ice diatom metabolomes and compatible solutes over a seasonal cycle could be significant components of biogeochemical cycling within sea ice.},

A novel treS gene with a length of 3,369 bp, encoding a protein of 1,122 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 126 kDa, was cloned from a marine Pseudomonas sp. P8005 (CCTCC: M2010298) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence identities between this novel TreS and other reported TreS is relatively low. The purified recombinant TreS showed an optimum pH and temperature of 7.2 and 37 °C, respectively. The enzyme displayed a high conversion rate (70 {\%}) of maltose to trehalose during equilibrium and had a higher catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for maltose than for trehalose, suggesting its application in the production of trehalose. In addition to maltose and trehalose, this enzyme can also act on sucrose, although this activity is relatively low. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that enzymatic activity was reduced dramatically by individually substitution with alanine for D78, Y81, H121, D219, E261, H331 or D332, which implied that these residues might be important in P8005-TreS. Experiments using isotope-labeled substrates showed that [2H2]trehalose combined with unlabeled trehalose was converted to [2H2]maltose and maltose, but without any production of [2H]maltose or [2H]trehalose and with no incorporation of exogenous [2H7]glucose into the disaccharides during the conversion catalyzed by this enzyme. This finding indicated the involvement of an intramolecular mechanism in P8005-TreS catalyzing the reversible interconversion of maltose and trehalose. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Taurine (Tau), an amino acid-like compound, is present in almost all marine metazoans including crustacean zooplankton. It plays an important physiological role in these organisms and is released into the ambient water throughout their life cycle. However, limited information is available on the release rates by marine organisms, the concentrations and turnover of Tau in the ocean. We determined dissolved free Tau concentrations throughout the water column and its release by abundant crustacean mesozooplankton at two open ocean sites (Gulf of Alaska and North Atlantic). At both locations, the concentrations of dissolved free Tau were in the low nM range (up to 15.7 nM) in epipelagic waters, declining sharply in the mesopelagic to about 0.2 nM and remaining fairly stable throughout the bathypelagic waters. Pacific amphipod–copepod assemblages exhibited lower dissolved free Tau release rates per unit biomass (0.8 ± 0.4 $\mu$mol g−1 C-biomass h−1) than Atlantic copepods (ranging between 1.3 ± 0.4 $\mu$mol g−1 C-biomass h−1 and 9.5 ± 2.1 $\mu$mol g−1 C-biomass h−1), in agreement with the well-documented inverse relationship between biomass-normalized excretion rates and body size. Our results indicate that crustacean zooplankton might contribute significantly to the dissolved organic matter flux in marine ecosystems via dissolved free Tau release. Based on the release rates and assuming steady state dissolved free Tau concentrations, turnover times of dissolved free Tau range from 0.05 d to 2.3 d in the upper water column and are therefore similar to those of dissolved free amino acids. This rapid turnover indicates that dissolved free Tau is efficiently consumed in oceanic waters, most likely by heterotrophic bacteria.},

abstract = {Most aquatic invertebrates adapt to environmental osmotic changes primarily by the cellular osmoconforming process, in which osmolytes accumulated in their cells play an essential role. Taurine is one of the most widely utilized osmolytes and the most abundant in many molluscs. Here, we report the structure, function and expression of the taurine transporter in the Mediterranean blue mussel (muTAUT), as a key molecule in the cellular osmoconforming process. Deduced amino acid sequence identity among muTAUT and vertebrate taurine transporters is lower (47-51{\%}) than that among vertebrate taurine transporters ({\textgreater}78{\%}). muTAUT has a lower affinity and specificity for taurine and a requirement for higher NaCl concentration than vertebrate taurine transporters. This seems to reflect the internal environment of the mussel; higher NaCl and taurine concentrations. In addition to the hyperosmotic induction that has been reported for cloned taurine transporters, the increase in muTAUT mRNA was unexpectedly observed under hypoosmolality, which was depressed by the addition of taurine to ambient seawater. In view of the decrease in taurine content in mussel tissue under conditions of hypoosmolality reported previously, our results lead to the conclusion that muTAUT does not respond directly to hypoosmolality, but to the consequent decrease in taurine content. By immunohistochemistry, intensive expression of muTAUT was observed in the gill and epithelium of the mantle, which were directly exposed to intensive osmotic changes of ambient seawater.},

abstract = {A metaproteomic survey of surface coastal waters near Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, was performed, revealing marked differences in the functional capacity of summer and winter communities of bacterioplankton. Proteins from Flavobacteria were more abundant in the summer metaproteome, whereas winter was characterized by proteins from ammonia-oxidizing Marine Group I Crenarchaeota. Proteins prevalent in both seasons were from SAR11 and Rhodobacterales clades of Alphaproteobacteria, as well as many lineages of Gammaproteobacteria. The metaproteome data were used to elucidate the main metabolic and energy generation pathways and transport processes occurring at the microbial level in each season. In summer, autotrophic carbon assimilation appears to be driven by oxygenic photoautotrophy, consistent with high light availability and intensity. In contrast, during the dark polar winter, the metaproteome supported the occurrence of chemolithoautotrophy via the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, respectively. Proteins involved in nitrification were also detected in the metaproteome. Taurine appears to be an important source of carbon and nitrogen for heterotrophs (especially SAR11), with transporters and enzymes for taurine uptake and degradation abundant in the metaproteome. Divergent heterotrophic strategies for Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria were indicated by the metaproteome data, with Alphaproteobacteria capturing (by high-affinity transport) and processing labile solutes, and Flavobacteria expressing outer membrane receptors for particle adhesion to facilitate the exploitation of non-labile substrates. TonB-dependent receptors from Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria (particularly in summer) were abundant, indicating that scavenging of substrates was likely an important strategy for these clades of Southern Ocean bacteria. This study provides the first insight into differences in functional processes occurring between summer and winter microbial communities in coastal Antarctic waters, and particularly highlights the important role that 'dark' carbon fixation has in winter.},

In the presence of moderate salinities Halobacillus halophilus mainly accumulates glutamine and glutamate to adjust turgor. The transcription of glnA2 (encoding a glutamine synthetase) as well as the glutamine synthetase activity were identified as chloride dependent steps. Halobacillus halophilus switches its osmolyte strategy and produces proline as the main compatible solute at high salinities. Furthermore, Halobacillus halophilus also shifts its osmolyte strategy at the transition from the exponential to the stationary phase where proline is exchanged by ectoine. Glutamate was found as a "second messenger" essential for proline production. This observation leads to a new model of sensing salinity by sensing the physico-chemical properties of different anions.},

Here, we utilized pre-extraction derivatization and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to detect and quantify targeted dissolved metabolites in seawater and saline culture media. Metabolites were derivatized with benzoyl chloride by their primary and secondary amine and alcohol functionalities and quantified using stable isotope-labeled internal standards (SIL-ISs) produced from 13 C 6-labeled benzoyl chloride. We optimized derivatization, extraction, and sample preparation for field and culture samples and evaluated matrix-derived biases. We have optimized this quantitative method for 73 common metabolites, of which 50 cannot be quantified without derivatization due to low extraction efficiencies. Of the 73 metabolites, 66 were identified in either culture media or seawater and 45 of those were quantified. This derivatization method is sensitive (detection limits = pM to nM), rapid (∼5 min per sample), and high throughput.},

Sea-ice diatoms have a number of adaptations, including accumulation of compatible solutes, that allows them to inhabit this highly variable environment characterized by extremes in temperature, salinity, and light. In addition to protecting them from extreme conditions, these compounds present a labile, nutrient-rich source of organic matter, and include precursors to climate active compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide [DMS]), which are likely regulated with environmental change. Here, intracellular concentrations of 45 metabolites were quantified in three sea-ice diatom species and were compared to two temperate diatom species, with a focus on compatible solutes and free amino acid pools. There was a large diversity of metabolite concentrations between diatoms with no clear pattern identifiable for sea-ice species. Concentrations of some compatible solutes (isethionic acid, homarine) approached 1 M in the sea-ice diatoms, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula cf. perminuta, but not in the larger sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei or in the temperate diatom species. The differential use of compatible solutes in sea-ice diatoms suggests different adaptive strategies and highlights which small organic compounds may be important in polar biogeochemical cycles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Over recent decades there have been numerous reports of the occurrence of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in marine organisms, including algae, zooplankton and fish, where it is proposed to function as an osmolyte and may be involved in a number of other physiological roles. While it may seem reasonable to assume that TMAO should also be present in seawater, to date its occurrence has not been reported. Here we report the first quantitative measurements of TMAO concentration and distribution in seawater. Results are also compared to the structurally and biochemically analogous sulphur compound, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and its precursor dimethylsulphide (DMS). Studies were conducted in the coastal waters off the Antarctic Peninsula between January and February 1999. Concentrations of dissolved TMAO ranged from below the analytical detection limit (1.65 nmol dm-3) to 76.9 nmol dm-3 in the upper water column (to 100 m), with a mean of 15.2 nmol dm-3. These concentrations are comparable to those of DMSO, (mean 8.7 nmol dm-3) and DMS (mean 3.0 nmol dm-3), and are highly comparable to those of other nitrogen species, such as the methylamines (MAs). In vertical profiles, greatest concentrations of TMAO were observed in surface waters where they exceeded those of all other methylamine analytes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a nitrogenous osmolyte widely distributed in marine organisms. The reduction of TMAO to TMA has long been implicated as characteristic reaction associated with fish and seafood spoilage. However, it is now apparent that, in the marine environment, TMAO can act as precursor to a range of reduced nitrogenous biogases that can play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and in the regulation of atmospheric pH. Although methods exist for the analysis of TMAO in some biological samples, they lack the sensitivity required for measurement of TMAO in natural waters. Here we present a new, safe and sensitive method for the determination of TMAO in aqueous and biological media, where TMAO is enzymatically reduced to TMA and subsequently quantified using Flow Injection Gas Diffusion-Ion Chromatography (Gibb et al. J. Autom. Chem. 1995, 17 (6), 205-212). The limit of detection was calculated to be 1.35 nmol dm-3 TMAO, and the response was linear for both fresh and seawater (R2 = 0.996 and 0.993, respectively). Precision (RSD) for standards in the range 40-600 nmol dm-3 was within 3{\%}. The specificity and competitive inhibition of the enzyme are addressed and the applicability of the technique demonstrated through analysis of a number of natural water and biological samples.},

No sample preparation is required and all naturally occurring amino acids plus ammonium are sufficiently separated within 30 min. Striking diel trends were observed to a depth of at least 60 m, with maximal DFAA concentrations (200-400 nM) in the late evening and minimal concentrations (30-40 nM) in the early day. Concurrent with the evening concentration maxima were elevated relative abundances of basic amino acids (especially ornithine and lysine) and ammonium. During the day very low levels of amino acids were found in the upper water. The magnitude of the night-to-day drop in total DFAA suggests a net heterotrophic uptake rate of up to {\$}6 \backslashmu g AA\backslashcdot liter{\^{}}-1\backslashcdot h{\^{}}-1{\$}. A pronounced amino acid maximum at the {\$}O{\_}2-HS{\^{}}-{\$} interface in the water column was presumably derived from microbial populations inhabiting this region.

abstract = {A variety of filtration and passive dialysis protocols were tested with seawater for determination of the dissolved concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPd), a compound originating in the cytosol of many marine phytoplankton. Commonly used sampling procedures, such as in-line filtration, syringe pressure filtration, and gravity filtration of relatively large-volume samples (5-50 mL) through glass fiber filters, caused release of DMSPd from particulate material as evidenced by increasing DMSPd concentrations with volume filtered. Exposure of filters to air at the end of filtration caused particularly severe DMSPd release. Dialysis bags or Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes equilibrated with seawater DMSPd within 4 h, even in polar waters (?1.8 °C), and appeared to give accurate DMSPd concentrations in some circumstances. However, incubation of seawater in laboratory containers (e.g., glass jars) during dialysis sometimes caused artifactual release of DMSPd. We therefore adopted a small-volume gravity drip filtration (SVDF) procedure, the essential elements of which were: (i) collection of 20 to 50 mL seawater directly from the primary sample container (e.g., Niskin bottle) into a dry, all-plastic filtration tower; (ii) use of a 47-mm-diameter Whatman GF/F filter; (iii) rapid ({\textless} 3 min) filtration by gravity (hydrostatic) pressure; (iv) collection of only the first 3.5 mL filtrate for DMSPd analysis; and (v) never exposing the filtered plankton to air. The SVDF procedure appeared to yield the same low DMSPd concentrations as dialysis samplers incubated in the ocean water column. Using the SVDF procedure, DMSPd was found to be {\textless} 2.8 nM over a broad range of ocean water types and particulate DMSP concentrations. The maximum DMSPd concentration observed in our study (2.8 nM) was far lower than the reported worldwide average DMSPd concentration of 16.9 nM, raising the possibility that past data collections may have been influenced by filtration artifacts.},

Using NMR and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy, we identified the main compatible solute in T. erythraeum strain IMS101 as the quaternary ammonium compound N,N,N-trimethyl homoserine (or homoserine betaine) and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway. The identification of this compatible solute explains how Trichodesmium spp. can thrive in the marine system at varying salinities and provides further insight into the diversity of microbial salt acclimation.},

abstract = {Organisms experience a wide range of environmental factors such as temperature, salinity and hydrostatic pressure, which pose challenges to biochemical processes. Studies on adaptations to such factors have largely focused on macromolecules, especially intrinsic adaptations in protein structure and function. However, micromolecular cosolutes can act as cytoprotectants in the cellular milieu to affect biochemical function and they are now recognized as important extrinsic adaptations. These solutes, both inorganic and organic, have been best characterized as osmolytes, which accumulate to reduce osmotic water loss. Singly, and in combination, many cosolutes have properties beyond simple osmotic effects, e.g. altering the stability and function of proteins in the face of numerous stressors. A key example is the marine osmolyte trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), which appears to enhance water structure and is excluded from peptide backbones, favoring protein folding and stability and counteracting destabilizers like urea and temperature. Co-evolution of intrinsic and extrinsic adaptations is illustrated with high hydrostatic pressure in deep-living organisms. Cytosolic and membrane proteins and G-protein-coupled signal transduction in fishes under pressure show inhibited function and stability, while revealing a number of intrinsic adaptations in deep species. Yet, intrinsic adaptations are often incomplete, and those fishes accumulate TMAO linearly with depth, suggesting a role for TMAO as an extrinsic 'piezolyte' or pressure cosolute. Indeed, TMAO is able to counteract the inhibitory effects of pressure on the stability and function of many proteins. Other cosolutes are cytoprotective in other ways, such as via antioxidation. Such observations highlight the importance of considering the cellular milieu in biochemical and cellular adaptation.},

Thanks to new technologies such as metagenomics, it is now possible to detect life in most extreme environments. Starting from the discovery of deep sea hydrothermal vents up to the study of marine biodiversity, new microorganisms have been identified, and their potential uses in several applied fields have been outlined. Thermophile, halophile, alkalophile, psychrophile, piezophile and polyextremophile microorganisms have been isolated from these marine environments; they proliferate thanks to adaptation strategies involving diverse cellular metabolic mechanisms. Therefore, a vast number of new biomolecules such as enzymes, polymers and osmolytes from the inhabitant microbial community of the sea have been studied, and there is a growing interest in the potential returns of several industrial production processes concerning the pharmaceutical, medical, environmental and food fields.},

abstract = {Coastal ocean bacterioplankton control the flow of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial and oceanic sources into the marine food web, and regulate the release of inorganic carbon to atmospheric and offshore reservoirs. While the fate of the chemically complex coastal DOC reservoir has long been recognized as a critical feature of the global carbon budget, it has been problematic to identify both the compounds that serve as major conduits for carbon flux and the roles of individual bacterioplankton taxa in mediating that flux. Here we analyse random libraries of expressed genes from a coastal bacterial community to identify sequences representing DOC-transporting proteins. Predicted substrates of expressed transporter genes indicated that carboxylic acids, compatible solutes, polyamines and lipids may be key components of the biologically labile DOC pool in coastal waters, in addition to canonical bacterial substrates such as amino acids, oligopeptides and carbohydrates. Half of the expressed DOC transporter sequences in this coastal ocean appeared to originate from just eight taxa: Roseobacter, SAR11, Flavobacteriales and five orders of gamma-Proteobacteria. While all major taxa expressed transporter genes for some DOC components (e.g. amino acids), there were indications of specialization within the bacterioplankton community for others (e.g. carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polyamines). Experimental manipulations of the natural DOC pool that increased the concentration of phytoplankton- or vascular plant-derived compounds invoked a readily measured response in bacterial transporter gene expression. This highly resolved view of the potential for carbon flux into heterotrophic bacterioplankton cells identifies possible bioreactive components of the coastal DOC pool and highlights differing ecological roles in carbon turnover for the resident bacterial taxa.},

The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints.

Ntr proteins assimilate ammonia, scavenge nitrogen-containing compounds, and appear to integrate ammonia assimilation with other aspects of metabolism, such as polyamine metabolism and glutamate synthesis. The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) controls the synthesis of glutamate synthase, which controls the Ntr response, presumably through its effect on intracellular glutamine. Some Ntr proteins inhibit the expression of some Lrp-activated genes. Guanosine tetraphosphate appears to control Lrp synthesis.

abstract = {Cyanobacteria are attractive microbial hosts for production of chemicals using light and CO2. However, their low productivity of chemicals is a major challenge for commercial applications. This is mostly due to their relatively slow growth rate and carbon partitioning toward biomass rather than products. Many cyanobacterial strains synthesize sucrose as an osmoprotectant to cope with salt stress environments. In this study, we harnessed the photosynthetic machinery of the fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 to produce sucrose under salt stress conditions and investigated if the high efficiency of photosynthesis can enhance the productivity of sucrose. By expressing the sucrose transporter CscB, Synechococcus 2973 produced 8 g L−1 of sucrose with a highest productivity of 1.9 g L−1 day−1 under salt stress conditions. The salt stress activated the sucrose biosynthetic pathway mostly via upregulating the sps gene, which encodes the rate-limiting sucrose-phosphate synthase enzyme. To alleviate the demand on high concentrations of salt for sucrose production, we further overexpressed the sucrose synthesis genes in Synechococcus 2973. The engineered strain produced sucrose with a productivity of 1.1 g L−1 day−1 without the need of salt induction. The engineered Synechococcus 2973 in this study demonstrated the highest productivity of sucrose in cyanobacteria.},

abstract = {Compatible solutes are a functional group of small, highly soluble organic molecules that demonstrate compatibility in high amounts with cellular metabolism. The accumulation of compatible solutes is often observed during the acclimation of organisms to adverse environmental conditions, particularly to salt and drought stress. Among cyanobacteria, sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol and glycine betaine are used as major compatible solutes. Interestingly, a close correlation has been discovered between the final salt tolerance limit and the primary compatible solute in these organisms. In addition to the dominant compatible solutes, many strains accumulate mixtures of these compounds, including minor compounds such as glucosylglycerate or proline as secondary or tertiary solutes. In particular, the accumulation of sucrose and trehalose results in an increase in tolerance to general stresses such as desiccation and high temperatures. During recent years, the biochemical and molecular basis of compatible solute accumulation has been characterized using cyanobacterial model strains that comprise different salt tolerance groups. Based on these data, the distribution of genes involved in compatible solute synthesis among sequenced cyanobacterial genomes is reviewed, and thereby, the major compatible solutes and potential salt tolerance of these strains can be predicted. Knowledge regarding cyanobacterial salt tolerance is not only useful to characterize strain-specific adaptations to ecological niches, but it can also be used to generate cells with increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions for biotechnological purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The most abundant class of bacterial ribosomal RNA genes detected in seawater DNA by gene cloning belongs to SAR11 - an $\alpha$-proteobacterial clade. Other than indications of their prevalence in seawater, little is known about these organisms. Here we report quantitative measurements of the cellular abundance of the SAR11 clade in northwestern Sargasso Sea waters to 3,000 m and in Oregon coastal surface waters. On average, the SAR11 clade accounts for a third of the cells present in surface waters and nearly a fifth of the cells present in the mesopelagic zone. In some regions, members of the SAR11 clade represent as much as 50{\%} of the total surface microbial community and 25{\%} of the subeuphotic microbial community. By extrapolation, we estimate that globally there are 2.4 × 1028 SAR11 cells in the oceans, half of which are located in the euphotic zone. Although the biogeochemical role of the SAR11 clade remains uncertain, these data support the conclusion that this microbial group is among the most successful organisms on Earth.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the oceans is one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on Earth, comparable in size to the atmospheric CO2 reservoir. A vast number of compounds are present in DOM, and they play important roles in all major element cycles, contribute to the storage of atmospheric CO2 in the ocean, support marine ecosystems, and facilitate interactions between organisms. At the heart of the DOM cycle lie molecular-level relationships between the individual compounds in DOM and the members of the ocean microbiome that produce and consume them. In the past, these connections have eluded clear definition because of the sheer numerical complexity of both DOM molecules and microorganisms. Emerging tools in analytical chemistry, microbiology, and informatics are breaking down the barriers to a fuller appreciation of these connections. Here we highlight questions being addressed using recent methodological and technological developments in those fields and consider how these advances are transforming our understanding of some of the most important reactions of the marine carbon cycle.},
